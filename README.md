## Environment Preparation

Instructions for Google Colab.

1. Created a new repo under one Github account of a member of our team.
1. Used pip to install all dependencies bearing in mind that Colab has built in TF/Pytorch installations. 
1. Installed [NNI](https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
1. Followed the instructions [here](https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sharings/nni_colab_support.html) to allow the UI to be visible.
1. Cloned the seed repo project located [here](https://github.com/bnsreenu/python_for_microscopists) - specifically under the directory `228_semantic_segmentation_of_aerial_imagery_using_unet`.

After NNI installation instructions were complete, NNI launched via the ngrok tunnel with an example experiment, as shown:
